# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉

Ever wanted a calculator that makes math feel like a party? You're in the right place!  
This little program will **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, and **divide** two numbers — all while keeping things light, fun, and beginner-friendly! 😎

---

## 🚀 What This Calculator Does

Once you run the script, you'll be prompted to:

1. ✍️ **Enter the first number**  
2. ✍️ **Enter the second number**

Then it will magically perform:

- ➕ **Addition**
- ➖ **Subtraction**
- ✖️ **Multiplication**
- ➗ **Division** (Assumes you're not dividing by zero... because we like our math drama-free 😅)

And finally, it reveals the results in a neat little summary. 🎊

## 📋 Sample Output

```bash
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
