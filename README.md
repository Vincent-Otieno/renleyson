## 🚀 What This Calculator Does

Once you run the script, you'll be prompted to:

1. ✍️ **Enter the first number**  
2. ✍️ **Enter the second number**

Then it will magically perform:

- ➕ **Addition**
- ➖ **Subtraction**
- ✖️ **Multiplication**
- ➗ **Division** (Assumes you're not dividing by zero... because we like our math drama-free 😅)

And finally, it reveals the results in a neat little summary. 🎊
